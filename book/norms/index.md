# Hackweek Norms

[Hackweeks](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/36/8872.short) are participant driven events that have been designed, evaluated and modified over the past eight years to meet the needs of emerging data science communities. Hackweeks were originally conceived within the [Moore/Sloan Data Science Environment](http://msdse.org/), and borrow ideas from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). 

Everyone involved in hackweeks, from participants to organizers, commit to a set of norms. We encourage you to read through our **[Code of Conduct](CoC)** and our commitment to building healthy **[Learning Communities](community)**.
