# ICESat-2 Resources

A large number of resources exist for helping you get and work with ICESat-2 data.
These range from packages and tutorials created by NSIDC, the DAAC that manages ICESat-2 data,
to community created libraries (such as [icepyx](https://icepyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [SlideRule](https://slideruleearth.io/)),
to individual GitHub repositories created by researchers using ICESat-2 data in their work.

## Lists of Resources
Both [icepyx](https://icepyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/resources.html) and [NSIDC](https://nsidc.org/data/icesat-2/tools) already have compiled lists of resources for obtaining and working with ICESat-2 data.
We encourage you to check them out, but have not recreated them here so you can always find the latest and greatest.

## Gallery of Tutorials
The Organizing Team (OT) has compiled this gallery of their favorite tutorials and tools for getting and utilizing ICESat-2 data to help you find great example workflows from across disciplines.
