# Making your data Findable and Accessible

The best way to make your data and code Findable and Accessible is to put it in an archive and assign a Persistent ID.  For data and code [Digital Object Identifiers](https://www.doi.org/) are the usual PID.  Most archives take care of DOIs for you.  You can even set Github up to assign a DOI to code.

Common Repositories are:

- NASA DAACs.  
- [The Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/) is the data center for NSF Arctic research.  
- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is an EU funded archive run ny CERN.  You can store data, code and presentations all with a DOI associated with your ORCiD.  
- [Pangea](https://www.pangaea.de/) is a data archive for geospatial Earth data.
