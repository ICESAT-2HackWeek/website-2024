# Making Data Interoperable and Reusable

We want to make sure that our data can be used by other researchers as easily as possible.

Ask yourself the question, if I dissappear for a month, can someone else open my data files, know what the data is, and start using the data?

The [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) principles layout systematic requirements to make data **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable and **R**eusable.  In this sectin we will focus on the Interoperable and Reusable parts of FAIR.

## Interoperable data

**Interoperability** means that data can be used by applications and in workflows for analysis, and can be integrated with other data.

I tend to think of interoperability as the number of steps (or headaches) required to read, transform and plot data.

- Is the data in a standard file format?
- Can the data be read by common tools?
- Is the data structured for analysis? 
- Does the file contain useful coordinates (datetime, x, y, z)?
- Does the file have a coordinate reference system?
- Do the variables have standard names, units, etc?

## Reusable data

**Reusability** means that the data have sufficient information about what it is, how it was collected and processed so that future users can understand the data and use it correctly.

I think of this as having most of my questions answered about the data.

- Is it appropriate to use this data for what I want to do?
