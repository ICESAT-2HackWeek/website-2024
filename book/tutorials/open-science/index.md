# Putting open science into practice

Focus on creating interpetable and reusable data

## Learning Objectives

- Students will know what metadata is required to make data interoperable and reusable.
    + this will be tested by a discussion of metadata required for one or more datasets.  The idea is that students will be given a small example dataset and asked to discuss what metadata is required to make a plot, transform it, etc
- Students will know why licenses are important for code and data and how to select a license.
    + we'll assign licenses to project or personal Github repos 
- Students will know how to assign persistent identifiers to data and code
    + ???

## Overview

Hopefully, all of you at the hackweek agree that making science more open is worthwhile and important.  In this tutorial we will show some ways to make science more open.  This is not meant to be a complete guide to open science.  Instead we will focus on how to make notebooks, scripts, datsets open. 

By the end of the week all of us will have written some code, processed some data and maybe even have some results.  The next step is to make sure that this effort is not lost or forgotten by you, your project group, other hackweek particpants, and even the Earth science community.

Take a moment to consider if, in a week or more time, you will be able to open a data file or notebook and relatively quickly pick up where you left off?  Will you project team members be able to take your code or data and start working on it?

[Allow a couple of minutes for discussion and a show of hands, maybe some feed back]

What, if anything, could you do to increase the chance of being able to get back into the project?
