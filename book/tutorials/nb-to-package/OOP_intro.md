# Intro to Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

In this tutorial, we'll be learning how to structure object-oriented code 
to take full advantage of this programming paradigm. 

Follow along with the slides [`here`](./OOP.pdf)!

We'll be using UCAR's ['Very Simple Climate Model'](https://scied.ucar.edu/interactive/simple-climate-model) as an example. 

Go ahead and preview the code we'll write together
- {download}`climate_model.py <./climate_model.py>`
- {download}`co2_emissions.py <./co2_emissions.py>`
- Some sample data: [`SSP_CO2emissions.csv`](./SSP_CO2emissions.csv)
