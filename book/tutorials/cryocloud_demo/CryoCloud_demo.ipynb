    "git clone https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/website-2024.git\n",

Time on the JupyterHub costs money and there are systems in place to make sure your server doesn't run indefinitely if you forget about it. After 90 minutes of no use, it will shut down. We prefer you shut down the server when so we save that 90 minutes of computing cost. To do so:\n",
