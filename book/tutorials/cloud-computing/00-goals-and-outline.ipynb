    "This tutorial is just the tip of the ice[SAT-2]berg (ðŸ˜¬) of cloud computing. It focuses on accessing data stored in the cloud. An understanding of the difference between the \"download to local\" and \"direct from cloud\" methods of data access will explain how and why the cloud facilitates the scaling and reproducibility of your science.\n",

    "1. What is cloud computing?\n",
    "2. What is cloud object storage and the difference between data stored in the cloud, data on a local file system and data stored in \"on-premise\" data centers.\n",
