    "**Cloud computing is compute and storage as a service.** The term \"cloud computing\" is typically used to refer to commercial cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure (Azure). These cloud service providers all offer a wide range of computing services, only a few of which we will cover today, via a pay-as-you-go payment structure.\n",

    ">Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
