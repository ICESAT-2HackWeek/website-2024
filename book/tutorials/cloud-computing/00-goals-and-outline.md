**At the conclusion of this tutorial, you should be able to answer:**

1. What is cloud computing?
2. What is cloud object storage and the difference between data stored in the cloud, data on a local file system and data stored in "on-premise" data centers.
3. How to optimize data for reading from cloud object storage.

## Outline

1. What is cloud computing?
   1. Definition
   2. Exercise: Difference between resources on your local machine and resources in the cloud
   3. Why you might use cloud computing
2. Cloud data access via cloud object storage
   1. Definition of cloud object storage
   2. Exercise: How many NASA datasets (aka collections) are in the cloud? How many ICESat-2 datasets are in the cloud? Which DAAC manages ICESast-2 data?
   3. Difference between data stored in the cloud, data on a local file system and data stored in "on-premise" data centers.
   4. Why you might use cloud object storage.
3. How to optimize data for reading from cloud object storage.
   1. What are we optimizing for and why?
   2. Anatomy of a structured data file.
   3. Thought Exercise: Garage analogy
   4. How do we optimize data for reading from cloud object storage?
4. Demo + Summary
   1. Lazy load ICESat-2 data using xarray
   2. Create a GeoDataFrame
   3. Plot the data with lonboard

Or simply: Cloud -> Accessing Data on the Cloud -> Cloud-optimized data access -> Cloud-optimized ICESat-2
