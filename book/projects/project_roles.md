# Project Roles and Responsibilities

## Project Lead

The project scientist roles are to:

* pitch initial project ideas and interact with all interested participants during networking.
* coordinate team building with other instructors to an optimal size of 4-7 total participants per team.  
* with help from the moderator, create a GitHub repository for your project. We recommend following the steps described on our [project initialization](project_initialization) page. 
* coordinate with the tutor/moderator to support the team, especially for the development of Github workflows that work for everyone to be able to contribute code. 
* oversee data management: be sure you have permission and consent to use data you share in the project and follow professional standards while using data for training that may be used in future publications. We recommend following the [AGU guidelines on data and consent ethics](https://ethics.agu.org/). 
* coordinate team activities and code to answer the research question; data, code, and tools originally proposed may change.    
* support each individual on your team to meeting their individual goals.

## Tutor / Moderator

The role of tutor / moderator includes:

* advising teams regarding data science practices and methodologies
* help coordinate a Github workflow
* enable and encourage participants to solve their problems in a way that builds confidence in their skills
