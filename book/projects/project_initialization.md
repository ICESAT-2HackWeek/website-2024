# Project Initialization

The project lead(s) should do the following:

## Decide on a short, memorable project name (discuss with your team)

## Create a new Slack channel for discussion:
1. Click “+” icon next to Channels list in Slack sidebar -> “Create a channel”
1. Use short project name
1. Invite your team members Slack members

## Create a new Github repo within the {{hackweek}} Organization:
1. Go to: {{ '[https://github.com/`{hw}`](https://github.com/{hw})'.format(hw=hackweek) }}
1. Click the green “New” button on right side of page
1. Select the "{{hackweek}}/sample_project_repository" template
1. Use short project name
1. We recommend choosing "Public" (so other participants can follow progress). You can also select Private for now and make Public before final presentation.

### Create a new Github team within the {{hackweek}} Organization:
GitHub teams provide a convenient way for you to set permissions on your project repository for groups of people, rather than having to do this for each individual on your team. 

1. Go to: {{ '[https://github.com/orgs/`{hw}`](https://github.com/orgs/{hw})'.format(hw=hackweek + "/teams") }} (or click the "Teams" tab near the top of the GitHub Organization page)
1. Click green “New team” button
1. Use your short project name for "Team name"
1. Set the team to visibility "Visible"
1. Click on the "Create Team" button
1. Add all team members by clicking the “Members” tab and the green “Add a member” button

### Add the project team to your project repo: 

1. Go to the new repository you just created 
1. Click “Settings” tab in upper right corner
1. Select “Manage access” on left side of page
1. Add your team name under the "Manage access" section
1. Select “write” to enable all team members to make commits
