# Participant Conduct

We require all participants in the University of Washington (UW) eScience Hackweek program to comply with the [eScience Code of Conduct](https://escience.washington.edu/about/code-of-conduct/) copied below.

Hackweek participants are intentionally diverse across many categories including academic standing, domain field, technical experience, etc., and we expect everyone to respect all perspectives represented. Please also read the [eScience Equity Statement](https://escience.washington.edu/about/equity-statement/).

## Code of Conduct

The University of Washington eScience Institute (“eScience”) is dedicated to providing a welcoming, supportive and inclusive environment for all people, regardless of background and identity. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, national origin or religion. Any form of behavior to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. By participating in this community, participants accept to abide by the eScience Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved.

In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviors on all platforms and during all events, both in-person and online:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully provide and accept constructive criticism
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Written or verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, national origin or religion
* Violent threats or language directed against another person
* Sexual language or images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) after being asked to stop
* Publication of private communication without consent
* Sustained disruption of talks, events, or communications
* Insults or put downs
* Nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any eScience events or activities, either online or in-person. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from participation at the discretion of eScience staff. The organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. 

Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our programming for everyone. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. You can make a report either personally or anonymously. To personally report, contact the eScience executive director, Sarah Stone, at sstone3@uw.edu or another trusted staff member. Anonymous reports can be made [here](https://bit.ly/uwhackweekfeedback). If you are experiencing a problem or issue that needs to be addressed by someone outside the program, you may contact the UW Office of the Ombud at ombuds@uw.edu or 206-543-6028.

[SafeCampus](https://www.washington.edu/safecampus/) (206-685-7233) is also available at any time to anonymously discuss safety and well-being concerns for yourself and others. SafeCampus is the University of Washington’s violence-prevention and response program, providing resources to UW students, staff, faculty and community members.
