### Slack Account

All of our communication throughout the hackweek will be done using the
{{ '[`{hackweek}` Slack workspace]({url})'.format(hackweek=hackweek, url=slack_workspace_url)}}.
With your invite to the hackweek, you should also have received a separate
email to join the Slack workspace. Upon accepting the invite, please take a moment to
[complete your Slack profile](https://slack.com/help/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile).
Having your name and picture with your Slack account helps us and your peers
to identify you on Slack and builds a more personal community throughout
the week.

### EarthData Login

We'll have you download some data from NSIDC for your tutorials and projects.
Visit the [Earthdata](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/earthdata-login)
help page and learn how to register, access, and login if you don't already have
an account!

### GitHub Account

Everyone attending {{ hackweek }} will require obtaining a GitHub account.
Visit [the GitHub help pages](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)
if you are in need for an account!

### JupyterHub

We will offer all tutorials based on a JupyterHub environment. Please visit the
[Project Pythia Foundation Skills](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-jupyter.html)
to learn more about the components of project Jupyter.

Specifically for the event, we will be using [CryoCloud](https://book.cryointhecloud.com/intro.html).
To get started, please see the [onboarding instructions](https://book.cryointhecloud.com/content/Getting_Started.html)
to gain access.

Optional setup after you are logged in CryoCloud:
* Earthdata authentication to automate data downloads:
  [Configure a netrc file](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/EL/How+To+Access+Data+With+cURL+And+Wget)
* Git authentication:

  All content of the hackweek will be shared via GitHub and interacting with the
  website will be done via the `git` command. See our {ref}`setting-up-git`
  to configure your access.
