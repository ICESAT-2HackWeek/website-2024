# Application

We are glad you are interested in applying to participate in {{hackweek}}! 

## Considerations

This event encourages collaboration between participants, rather than competition, and provides extensive opportunities each day for participants to work with each other. We welcome applications from researchers at all stages in their careers, as well as from industry. In addition, we welcome participants from a wide range of backgrounds and experience levels with data science-related methods and tools, from beginners to experts.

Participant selection will be made with the goal of enhancing the data science community within our scientific domain, and we particularly encourage requests to attend from junior participants and people who are new to data-driven science. Note that we will reserve spaces for one person from each of the SnowEx science team.

Our events are often over-subscribed so we ask that you ensure you can attend the majority of our sessions during {{dates}} before applying.
