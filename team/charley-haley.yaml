  bio: I am passionate about all things that are in service to building collaborations, especially interdisciplinary ones.
    I love building frameworks that make it easier for science groups (research, applied, data, stakeholders) to understand
    each other and how they might fit together to address the larger, more complex science challenges that are impossible to
    touch without a community of collaborators representing all angles & all perspectives.
